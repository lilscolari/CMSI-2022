This is an iOS application that displays movies from the top 200 box office movies worldwide. The application displays 10 movies at a time by making an API call to the MoviesDatabase API. To get the next 10 movies, users can click the 'Next Page' button which then makes another API call and displays the next ten movies to the user. To reset the page back to the initial, there is a "Back to Page 0" button that resets the page number and returns the initial page upon the next 'Next Page' press.

Users also have the option to switch tabs to the random tab that has a button. Upon click, this button returns a random movie from the top 200 box office list.

Both the random movie request and top 200 box office movies request are endpoints in the API we are using. Here is a link to the documentation: https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/tutorials/moviesdatabase-documentation
