### State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience:
As music lovers, we believe that the music industry is split. Artists sign with labels and the work that is published is regulated. 
Because of this, songs can only be published on certain platforms with some songs never even being released. With music on different
platforms, it is too difficult to listen to all the songs you enjoy. Our chosen audience is people who are 13+, but we also considered an audience of people who enjoy music. We want to make listening to music easier for music lovers but since this app
will allow users to connect with each other, we need to set age parameters.
### State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered:
We want to build an app where people can gather music from different sources and collect them for their own entertainment. This would
allow people to enjoy the songs they enjoy without having to switch platforms. Although a majority of music is available on spotify/apple music, some songs are only available on YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.. If we make a place where people can download and stream all 
their favorite songs, it will be very useful for people who enjoy all types of music like us.
### State the final app idea that your team has decided to do:
For our final app, we have decided to make a music social media app where users can gather songs from different sources and store
them all in one location. We will use firebase to store user data and song data. We will use different API's to allow for the
download of audios from different sources.
