# Project Ideation
## 1. Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?
   The audiences we considered were children, adults, music enjoyers, students, anyone, and friends. Friends was 
   too narrow of an audience and anyone was too broad. Music enjoyers was a strong audience but that would limit 
   our options for an app. We also did not want to make an app for students because that is also too broad of an 
   audience. We decided that since we wanted to make something similar to a social media app, it would be best to 
   have an audience who is aged 13+.
## 2. List the ten needs that you identified for your chosen audience:
   * <ins>Good user interface.</ins> Good choice of aesthetic and display.
   * <ins>Customizable.</ins> User can edit things as they please to personalize the app.
   * <ins>Easy to use.</ins> Easy to navigate. Coincides with good user interface.
   * <ins>Enjoyment.</ins> How fun is it?
   * <ins>Entertainment.</ins> App should provide entertainment to user so they keep using it.
   * <ins>Audio.</ins> Audio feedback.
   * <ins>Interaction with other users.</ins> Messaging, posting, following.
   * <ins>Public content.</ins> Explore pages, post leaderboards.
   * <ins>Images.</ins> Image upload, image display.
   * <ins>Privacy.</ins> Private data, private content.
## 3. State the three needs that were chosen out of the ten, and state the projects that you mapped to those needs:
   Audio, entertainment, customizable. music download, music social media app, social media.
## 4. For each of the three projects, list the goals/ideas that you brainstormed for them

## 5. State the “winner” of this process
   music social media app. We believe that the best idea is the music social media app because it is something new. We can 
   have people post their song of the day which will help songs become more popular and just allow people to interact with 
   people who share similar musical interests. We think it could be really cool for people to share their favorite songs with 
   others and make playlists together.
