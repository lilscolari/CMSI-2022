This is an iPhone application dedicated to providing users with up-to-date information about the current English Premier League football teams.
Utilizing SwiftUI, we integrated our own data on the English Premier League to be displayed within the application.
Users can select their favorite teams and filter the list of teams for easier search. Each details page also has a list of the team's most recent starting eleven man roster.
We are proud of our work on the maps of each stadium, where we had to rescale and update to get satellite images of the unique stadiums.
Additionally, organizing content on the details page was a challenge and finally seeing our result come together was worth the time spent struggling to redesign the page.
Photos for each team were taking from https://www.premierleague.com/clubs and each team's individual page.
The photo for the app icon and the Premier League photo at the bottom of each details page was found at https://dorve.com/blog/ux-news-articles-archive/premier-league-logo-2023/.
To top everything off, we used animations and shapes to enhance the quality of our application.
